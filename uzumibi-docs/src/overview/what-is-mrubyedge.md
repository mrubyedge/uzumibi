# What is mruby/edge?

[mruby/edge](https://github.com/mrubyedge/mrubyedge) is a specialized implementation of mruby, optimized specifically for edge computing scenarios. It's designed to run efficiently in WebAssembly environments with limited resources.

Key features of mruby/edge:

- **Optimized for WebAssembly**: Compiled to WASM for fast startup and low memory footprint
- **Minimal Runtime**: Stripped-down Ruby implementation suitable for edge environments
- **No GC Overhead**: Carefully managed memory allocation for predictable performance
- **Edge-Optimized**: Built specifically for constrained computing environments
