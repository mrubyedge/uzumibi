# Service Worker Sample

A sample project for using WASM with Service Workers.

## File Structure

- `public/index.html`: Main HTML file. Registers the Service Worker and displays results.
- `public/service-worker.js`: Service Worker implementation. Loads WASM module and routes requests through it.
- `public/app.wasm`: Compiled WASM module (copied from build output).
- `lib/app.rb`: Ruby routing definition using Uzumibi framework.
- `src/lib.rs`: Rust code that initializes mruby VM and exports WASM functions.
- `build.rs`: Build script that compiles Ruby code to mruby bytecode.

## How It Works

1. Access `public/index.html`
2. JavaScript registers the Service Worker
3. Service Worker loads the WASM module (`app.wasm`)
4. User clicks a button to send a fetch request to `/`, `/hello`, or `/profile`
5. Service Worker intercepts the request, packs it into WASM memory format
6. WASM module (mruby runtime) executes the Ruby router code
7. Ruby code generates a response based on the route
8. Service Worker unpacks the response from WASM memory
9. Response is displayed on the page

## Building

### Using Make (Recommended)

```bash
make wasm
```

This will build the WASM module and copy it to the public directory.

Other available commands:
- `make build` - Build WASM module only
- `make copy` - Copy WASM to public directory only
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `make serve` - Start development server

### Manual Build

First, build the WASM module:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

Then copy the WASM file to the public directory:

```bash
cp ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/uzumibi_on_serviceworker_spike.wasm public/app.wasm
```

## Running

Service Workers only work over HTTPS or localhost. Start a local server:

### Using Make

```bash
make serve
```

### Using Python 3

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000 -d public
```

### Using Node.js http-server

```bash
npx http-server public -p 8000
```

After starting the server, access `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.

## Development

### Clearing Cache During Development

When developing and testing changes, you may need to clear the Service Worker cache:

**Method 1: Clear Site Data (Recommended)**
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. In the left sidebar, click **Storage** (under Application section)
4. Click **Clear site data** button
5. Reload the page

**Method 2: Unregister Service Worker**
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. In the left sidebar, click **Service Workers** (under Application section)
4. Click **Unregister** next to your Service Worker
5. Reload the page

**Note:** Super reload (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) bypasses Service Workers by design, but won't clear cached data. Use the methods above for a clean restart during development.

## Verification

1. Open browser developer tools
2. Check logs in the Console tab - you should see WASM debug messages
3. Check registration status in Application tab → Service Workers
4. Click the buttons to make requests to different routes
5. Verify that responses are generated by the Ruby code running in WASM

## Next Steps

- Add POST request support
- Implement more complex routing patterns
- Add request body handling
- Optimize WASM module size
