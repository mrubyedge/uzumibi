# Limitations

Due to the constrained edge environment and mruby limitations:

- No file system access
- Limited Ruby standard library
- No native C extensions
- Memory constraints vary by platform
- No background jobs or async processing within a request

See [Supported Platforms](./platforms.md) for platform-specific limitations and features.
