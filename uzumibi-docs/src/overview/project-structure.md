# Project Structure

The Uzumibi project consists of several crates:

- **uzumibi-cli**: CLI tool for project generation
- **uzumibi-gem**: Core framework functionality
- **uzumibi-art-router**: Routing library
- **uzumibi-on-*-spike**: Example implementations for each platform

Each spike project demonstrates how to integrate Uzumibi with a specific edge platform.
