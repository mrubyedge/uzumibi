# Choosing a Platform

Consider these factors when choosing a platform:

- **Global Performance**: Cloudflare Workers or Fastly Compute for worldwide low latency
- **Execution Time**: Cloud Run if you need longer execution times
- **Open Source**: Spin for self-hosted or cloud-agnostic deployments
- **Cost**: Compare pricing for your expected traffic patterns
- **Integration**: Choose based on existing cloud provider relationships
- **Development**: Service Worker for local testing and development
