# What is Uzumibi?

Uzumibi is a lightweight web application framework designed for edge computing platforms. The name "Uzumibi" (うずみび) is a Japanese term that refers to live embers buried under a layer of ash to keep the fire from going out. This metaphor represents how Uzumibi keeps Ruby alive in the constrained environments of edge computing.

The framework enables developers to:

- Write serverless applications in Ruby for edge platforms
- Deploy to multiple edge providers (Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Spin, etc.)
- Build high-performance applications optimized for WebAssembly
- Use a familiar Sinatra-like routing DSL
