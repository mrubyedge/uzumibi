# Future Commands

Planned additions to the CLI:

- `uzumibi build`: Build the project for the current platform
- `uzumibi dev`: Start local development server
- `uzumibi deploy`: Deploy to the configured platform
- `uzumibi init`: Initialize Uzumibi in an existing project
- `uzumibi add-service`: Add external service integration

These commands are not yet implemented but are planned for future releases.
